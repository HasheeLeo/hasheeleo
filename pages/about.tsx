      I am proficient in web development and app development in React/React Native. I have worked extensively in
      Laravel. I am an expert in C/C++ and Java. I also work in deep learning using PyTorch. Currently, I am doing
      research on change detection in remote sensing using convolutional neural networks with the aim to contribute
      something meaningful to the field.

      When I am not programming, I love to read and write fantasy and dabble in world-building.
